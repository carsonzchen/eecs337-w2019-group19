Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language:



Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series - Drama:
Excuse me Juliane Moore. But Jessica Lange was THE best mini series drama actress this year. Sit back down. #goldenglobes
Why did they give out best drama series before they presented best actress in a drama series? #GoldenGlobes
Love Homeland &amp; glad it won! (Did we miss best actress is TV drama category?!) #liveTVcanbeawkward #ilovepaulrudd #GoldenGlobes



Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy:
Give me Lincoln for Best Movie Drama; Silver Linings Playbooks for Comedy/Musical. Homeland for Tv drama and Girls for comedy. #goldenglobes
Best Motion Picutre - Comedy or Musical:  Les Misrables  #GoldenGlobes
#GoldenGlobes best comedy/musical nominee 'Les Mis' - wonderful production value, a musical on an epic scale - but the story has real holes
It's weird that they put comedy and musical in the same category (best motion picture), considering Les Mis is nominated... #GoldenGlobes
Let's hope the Hollywood Foreign Press made the right choice: Les Mis for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy #GoldenGlobes



Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy:
Best tv series comedy: @girlsHBO #GoldenGlobes



Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama:
#GoldenGlobes  This year's best performance for reality, drama and comedy: Ms @NeNeLeakes !!! @Bravotv
How has #Homeland won Best Drama before Claire Danes has won Best Actress? #GoldenGlobes
Homeland dominating Golden Globes again.  Best Actor, best drama and you know Danes will take best actress.



Best Performance by an Actress in a Limited Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television:
AHHH:D well Julianne is good actress! :) @ANCALERTS #GoldenGlobes  Best Actress in a Mini-Series or TV Movie: Julianne Moore ('Game Change')
