"Best Actress in a Television Series - Drama" dimenangkan Claire Danes dari film Homeland #GoldenGlobes



Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy:
Give me Lincoln for Best Movie Drama; Silver Linings Playbooks for Comedy/Musical. Homeland for Tv drama and Girls for comedy. #goldenglobes
Best Motion Picutre - Comedy or Musical:  Les Misrables  #GoldenGlobes
#GoldenGlobes best comedy/musical nominee 'Les Mis' - wonderful production value, a musical on an epic scale - but the story has real holes
It's weird that they put comedy and musical in the same category (best motion picture), considering Les Mis is nominated... #GoldenGlobes
Let's hope the Hollywood Foreign Press made the right choice: Les Mis for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy #GoldenGlobes
Me alegro demasiado que Best Comedy or Musical ganar Extico Hotel Marigold, es otra cosa esa pelicula. #GoldenGlobes
@glasneronfilm @ZulekhaNathoo Best Actress-Drama, I'm calling Naomi Watts.  Best Actress-Musical/Comedy, Jennifer Lawrence. #goldenglobes
Bill Clinton for Best Picture (Comedy or Musical) #GoldenGlobes
Do you think they will ever nominate a comedy movie in the best comedy category? #goldenglobes
#GoldenGlobes fingers crossed we win tonight! Best supporting band in a comedy or musical!
Something odd about the Golden Globes: lumping Musical and Comedy in same category. About 90% of Les Mis is the antithesis of comedy.
Eddie Redmayne gets the Globen Globe for Best Freckles in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy #GoldenGlobes
Tommy Lee Jones has just been nominated for best dramatic role during comedy at a musical or awards show. #GoldenGlobes
